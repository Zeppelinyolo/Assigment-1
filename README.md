So i made a website made to advertise for a company selling doors, DoorsCentral.
The images of doors used were simply just expensive loing front doors that i have had taken a photo of, hence the slightly lower quality
The color scheme of the website is a very warm-y brown orange combo, giving a very wooden and hearth feel to the site, representing the front entrance of your warm home.
